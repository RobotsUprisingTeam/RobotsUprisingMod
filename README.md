# 🤖 Robots Uprising Mod 🤖

Robots Uprising Mod is a mod that allows you to play 2 new civilisations : 
- Robots
- Humans (still in dev)

The mod is only available in multiplayer, we added many new features and mechanics so the AI PetraBot of 0 A.D can't play with you.

##  📰 DOCUMENTS 📰

The Robots Uprising Team did some documents to describe our vision of the project, the reasons why choices has been made. We advise you to read it if you want to modify the mod, we think that it can help you to understand the project in his globality.

In the folder Documents, you will find some documents we did for our exams

## ✨ GAMEPLAY CHANGES ✨

- Resources collecting changes : If you want to collect resources, you will have to build a drill (it will have to match the resource it will drill to). To collect resources, you will have to make your workers OR your resources transporter (spaceship) gather the resources directly from the drill.
- New resource : This mod adds a new resource : Starcilite. This resource appears every 5 minutes on the map, randomly placed. To collect it, only your workers will be useful. This resource will make you able to build a factory which is able to create a MEKA Elite unit.
- MEKA Elite : this unit is only creatable with a certain amount of Starcilite, it's a very strong unit which can only be created one time.
- Spaceships : This mod add new units which are able to fly around the map with different usings for each of them. 
- Switches : Some buildings (Factories) are able to switch between two states : Static and Mobile.
